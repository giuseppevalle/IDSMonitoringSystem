# IDSMonitoringSystem
I made this project for my Master Thesys. The goal is to create a rule-based Intrusion Detection System with the use of semantic analysis. 
It is developed to detect attacks in cloud structures (such as a web server in cloud).

## Built With
The following are required for the usage:
* [Ossec](https://www.ossec.net/) - A host-based IDS configured as agent/server. 
* [Snort](https://www.snort.org/) - A Network Intrusion Detection & Prevention System on each node of the architecture.
* [GSON](https://github.com/google/gson) - Used to parser the alerts genereted by ossec.
* [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/) - A prolog environment.
* [JPL](https://jpl7.org/) - A library available for SWI-Prolog to execute Prolog queries in Java and viceversa. 

## Description
It includes:
* an ontology, written as a prolog file to execute query and obtain new knowledge (System10.pl)
* a tool developed in java that automatically detect attack symptoms.
* an example of alerts (alerts.json), provided by ossec, that work as input for the attack detection

## Installation
Clone the github repository and change the path of the reader selecting the right alerts.json path (file of alerts generated by ossec).
In the function getListAlertsFromJSON():
```java
reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(rightPath));
```
Next, you have to add as external library the jpl.jar available for SWI-Prolog (more info [here](https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/packages-jpl/wiki/Installing-&-Using-JPL)).


## Usage
The current version provide some attack's simptoms related to the correspondent alerts, you can just run it after the installation and check if those attacks and attack scenario are detected.

## Contribution
The ontology can be expanded with new attacks, simptomps, alerts, etc. increasingly the accuracy of the detection.
